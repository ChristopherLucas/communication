Description: Provides fast, easy feature extraction of human speech and model estimation
	     with hidden Markov models. Flexible extraction of phonetic features and their
	     derivatives, with necessary preprocessing options like feature standardization.
	     Communication can estimate supervised and unsupervised hidden Markov models with
	     these features, with cross validation and corrections for auto-correlation in
	     features.
